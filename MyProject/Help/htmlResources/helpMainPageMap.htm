	    <p>
		In the center of the main window is placed World Map. Map is used to display monuments. Monuments on map are represented just with their
	      <i>icon</i>. More information about monument can be given by putting mouse over icon. Then the text with information pops up as a tooltip.
		It gives information about monument's <i>ID</i> (Sequence of characters which is unique within all monuments), <i>name</i> and <i>type</i>.
	    </p>
	    <p>	
		Monuments can be put on the map by using <i><b>drag and drop</b></i> method. They can be dragged from <a href="helpMainPageList.htm">List view of monuments.</a>
		Dragged monument can be dropped anywhere on the map. Only constraint about dropping monument is that two monuments <i> can't be dropped on the same position</i>. 
		Dropped monument can be moved on the other position by dragging its icon and dropping it on desired new position. User can also <i>zoom</i> the map
		to see some monument or some country position better. Zooming of the map can be done by pulling the <i>zoom slider</i>. Zoom slider is placed in
		<a href="helpMainPageStatusbar.htm">Application's footer.</a> Drag and drop example is displayed below.
