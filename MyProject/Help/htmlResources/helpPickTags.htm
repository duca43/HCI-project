			Monuments can be tagged with no one, one or more tags by using this dialog. On the left side is
			list of available tags (those with whom the monument is not tagged) and on the rigth side there
			is list of chosen tags for that monument. To choose new tag, you have to put it from the list of available
			tags to list of chosen tags. There is 3 ways to perform choosing. First one is by selecting the certain tag
			on the left side and click on <b>&gt</b> button. Second one also requires selecting the certain tag and after
			that you have to press <b>the rigth arrow button</b> on the keyboard. And the last way is to use <b>drag and drop</b>
			method. You can draq the certain tag from the list of available tags and drop it in the list of chosen tags.
			Every of three methods has the opposite method. That means you can put the tag from the list of chosen tags back
			to list of available tags just by perforiming the opposite actions (<b>&lt</b> button, <b>the left arrow button</b> 
			on the keyboard or <b>drag and drop</b> in the opposite direction). When choosing is finished, click on the <i>Finish</i>
			button to go back to <i>Add new monument dialog</i> or <i>Edit monument dialog</i>.
