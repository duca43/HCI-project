			two modes of displaying data - <i>collapsed</i> or <i>expanded</i>. Mode can be switched with click on the
			button in the lower left corner (See on the two images bellow the text). In collapsed mode is displayed
			just the most important data: Icon, ID, Name and Type. In expanded mode is displayed all of the data about monuments.

			Next to the Expand/Collapse button are there more buttons: <i>Add</i>, <i>Edit</i> and <i>Delete</i>. Add button
			opens a dialog for adding a new monument. Edit button opens a dialog for editing a monument which is <i>selected in table</i>.

			a text field <i>Search</i>. It can be used to search for the one or more monuments by their <b>ID</b>. Bellow the search text field
			is placed <i>Filter data</i> section. Data displayed in the table can be filtered by 4 different parameters: <i>type</i>, <i>tags</i>,
