		<p>
		  There are three entities that can be added or edited by user. Each of entity has own two dialogs - one to add and other one
		  to edit existing entity. It gives six dialogs in total for adding new entities and editing them by inputing or picking data.
		  Dialogs for adding new and editing existing one are almost the same. Difference is that dialog for editing is opening with all the
		  data filled in and user can quickly change the parameter as desired. In the header of dialogs is indicated what kind of dialog it is.
